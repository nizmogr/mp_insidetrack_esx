Horse Bet script (Inside Track) for ESX Framework.

I modified MRV6 Inside Track for ESX framework compatibility for my server and decided to share it for those who don't know how make it by themselves.

Didn't realy do much, just added a configurable drawmarker and item as currency(you can change it to whatever item you like(Me for example use chips))
You can edit the config.lua to your liking.

Also I use t-notify for notifications so you can either use it too or delete the export from client.lua. Im on ESX 1.6 and using ox_inventory and didn't found any bugs.
