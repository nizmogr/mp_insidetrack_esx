Horse Bet script (Inside Track) for ESX Framework.

I modified MRV6 Inside Track for ESX framework compatibility

Didn't realy do much, just added a configurable drawmarker and item as currency(you can change it to whatever item you like(Me for example use chips))
You can edit the config.lua to your liking.

Also I use t-notify for notifications so you can either use it too or delete the export from client.lua
